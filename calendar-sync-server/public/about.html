        Our project is focused on making a calender that students can see for various Learning management system softwares
            for all of their classes, ranging from Prarielearn to Moodle to Canvas. CalendarSync brings your assignments
            from these softwares together so instead of wasting your time keeping track of the individual calendars that each service
        provides, we will unify these sources and produce a single, easy to use calendar for students. We hope you find it useful!
